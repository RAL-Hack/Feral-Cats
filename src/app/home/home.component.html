<p class="infoBlurb">Use your imagination, let it go. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.</p>
<p class="infoBlurb">You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Those great big fluffy clouds. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it.</p>
<p class="infoBlurb"> See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. There are no limits in this world. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk.</p>
<p class="infoBlurb">This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are.</p>
